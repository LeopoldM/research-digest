    <div class="intro">
        <strong>📊 Today's Summary</strong><br>
        This research digest covers 16 papers spanning several key areas in economic theory and energy markets. The collection is dominated by mechanism design studies (9 papers) exploring topics from satellite network resource management to AI governance in multi-agent markets, complemented by work in screening theory, auction mechanisms, and market operations. Particularly notable are papers examining optimal carbon pricing with regional welfare considerations and a novel approach to stability-constrained market clearing for high-renewable power systems, both directly relevant to contemporary energy policy challenges.

        <div class="paper-summary">This paper surveys how game-theoretic and auction-based incentive mechanisms can address resource allocation challenges in satellite networks, which face unique constraints from mobility, coverage, and energy/computation limitations. The methodology is a comprehensive literature review examining mechanism design applications across communication allocation, computation offloading, privacy/security, and coordination problems in satellite systems. The key contribution is demonstrating that economic incentive mechanisms can improve upon traditional performance-metric approaches by incorporating user rationality and behavior, thereby enhancing scalability, adaptability, and fairness in satellite resource management.</div>

        <div class="paper-summary">This paper examines why the US and China are accelerating AI investment despite catastrophic risks, which contradicts standard real options theory that predicts delay under high uncertainty. The authors develop a continuous-time preemption game model where AGI development creates endogenous existential risk shared globally, causing the risk term to cancel out of players&#x27; equilibrium conditions. The key finding is that competitive dynamics create a &quot;suicide region&quot; where rational actors deploy AGI systems early despite negative risk-adjusted NPV, and this can only be prevented by internalizing ruin costs through sufficient private liability thresholds.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="paper-summary">This paper addresses how to efficiently allocate spectrum between incumbent non-commercial users (government agencies, scientific institutions) and commercial users when direct monetary transfers are prohibited and both parties have private information about their valuations. The authors use mechanism design theory to characterize the optimal allocation mechanism under these constraints of limited transfers and asymmetric information. The key contribution is developing a novel theoretical framework that determines efficient resource allocation without monetary transfers, with applications extending beyond spectrum to other government-held resources where commercial incentives could distort public missions.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="paper-summary">This paper examines how a designer should optimally manage information revelation when agents have partial private information about a common-value good and the designer wants to maximize allocation without monetary transfers. Using mechanism design theory, the authors characterize optimal mechanisms under general information distributions and show that these can be parameterized by allocation probability and induced learning intensity. The key finding is that optimal mechanisms sometimes withhold allocation even when it would be socially efficient, because managing learning incentives creates a trade-off between immediate allocation and preserving information revelation that enables future allocations.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="paper-summary">This paper investigates whether automated recruitment systems using keyword-based screening contribute to artificially high frictional unemployment despite abundant job vacancies. The authors use controlled simulations comparing traditional keyword screening against semantic matching with high-dimensional vector representations of resumes and job descriptions. The key finding is that semantic matching substantially improves recall and matching efficiency without sacrificing precision, suggesting that outdated algorithmic screening creates significant artificial friction in labor markets and proposing a standardized workforce architecture to improve human capital signal alignment.</div>

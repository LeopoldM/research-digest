        <div class="paper-summary">This survey paper examines how incentive mechanism design based on game theory and auction theory can address resource management challenges in satellite networks, which face constraints from high mobility, long propagation distances, and limited energy/communication/computation resources. The methodology is a comprehensive literature review analyzing existing theoretical and applied work on economic mechanisms for satellite resource allocation. The key contribution is identifying how incentive-based approaches can improve upon traditional rigid allocation methods by incorporating user rationality and behavior, leading to better scalability, adaptability, and fairness in satellite network resource management across domains including communication, computation offloading, security, and coordination.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="paper-summary">This paper examines why the US and China are accelerating AGI development despite acknowledging catastrophic risks, contradicting standard real options theory that predicts investment delay under extreme uncertainty. The authors develop a continuous-time preemption game with endogenous existential risk, where the cost of failure includes a global systemic ruin parameter rather than just sunk investment costs. The key finding is that shared catastrophic risk creates a &quot;suicide region&quot; where competitive pressures force rational actors to deploy AGI early despite negative risk-adjusted NPV, because the risk term cancels out of players&#x27; equilibrium conditions, and this dynamic can only be resolved by internalizing ruin costs through private liability mechanisms.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="paper-summary">This paper addresses the optimal allocation of government-held spectrum between incumbent non-commercial users (federal agencies, defense, public safety) and commercial users when direct monetary transfers are prohibited and both parties have private information about their valuations. The authors use mechanism design theory to characterize the optimal allocation mechanism under these constraints. The key contribution is showing that the optimal mechanism involves costly inspections to verify incumbent valuations and demonstrating how efficiency losses arise from the combination of transfer restrictions and information asymmetries, providing theoretical foundations for spectrum sharing policies beyond traditional market-based approaches.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="paper-summary">This paper examines how a designer should optimally manage information aggregation when agents have partial private information about a common-value good and the designer seeks to maximize allocations without monetary transfers. Using mechanism design theory, the authors characterize the optimal mechanism through two key parameters: one controlling allocation probability and another governing learning incentives. The key finding is that the optimal mechanism sometimes withholds socially efficient allocations to maintain proper learning incentives, demonstrating a fundamental trade-off between immediate efficiency and information aggregation in mechanism design.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="paper-summary">This paper investigates whether automated keyword-based recruitment systems contribute to artificially high frictional unemployment by creating semantic mismatches between job seekers and vacancies. The authors use controlled simulations comparing traditional keyword screening with semantic matching via high-dimensional vector representations of resumes and job descriptions. The key finding is that semantic matching substantially improves recall and matching efficiency without sacrificing precision, suggesting that algorithmic barriers in hiring systems impose significant economic costs and that better semantic alignment could reduce frictional unemployment.</div>

        <strong>📊 Today's Summary</strong><br>
        This digest covers 15 papers spanning several key areas in energy economics and related fields. The collection is dominated by mechanism design research (10 papers) exploring topics from satellite network resource management to multi-agent learning systems, complemented by studies in auction theory, screening models, and climate policy. Of particular note is &quot;AI in Charge: Large-Scale Experimental Evidence on Electric Vehicle Charging Demand&quot; by Metcalfe et al., which provides direct experimental insights into EV charging behavior, and &quot;Optimal Carbon Prices in an Unequal World&quot; which addresses critical questions around equitable climate policy design.

        <div class="paper-summary">This paper investigates whether AI-managed dynamic pricing can effectively shift electric vehicle charging demand to align with low-carbon electricity supply and reduce system costs. The researchers conducted a large-scale randomized field experiment across multiple countries (UK, US, Germany, Spain) with financial incentives for EV tariff enrollment, analyzing charging behavior and demand patterns over more than a year. They find that the AI-managed tariff achieved a 42% reduction in peak-hour household electricity demand with complete load shifting to lower-cost/lower-carbon periods, generated substantial consumer savings, and demonstrated low AI override rates, suggesting superior efficiency compared to real-time pricing without AI coordination.</div>

        <div class="paper-summary">This paper addresses the research question of how to design effective incentive mechanisms for resource management in satellite networks, which face unique challenges due to mobility, coverage, propagation delays, and resource constraints. The methodology is a comprehensive theoretical survey that examines game theory and auction theory-based approaches across key satellite network applications including communication resource allocation, computation offloading, privacy/security, and coordination. The key contribution is demonstrating how economic incentive mechanisms can complement traditional system-performance approaches by incorporating user rationality and behavior to improve scalability, adaptability, and fairness in satellite resource allocation.</div>

        <div class="paper-summary">This paper examines why major powers are accelerating AI development despite acknowledging catastrophic risks from AGI misalignment, contrary to standard real options theory which predicts delay under extreme uncertainty. Using a continuous-time preemption game with endogenous existential risk, the authors show that when catastrophic failure costs are shared globally, the risk term cancels out of players&#x27; equilibrium conditions, creating a &quot;suicide region&quot; where rational agents deploy AGI early despite negative risk-adjusted NPV. The key contribution is demonstrating that competitive pressures can force premature deployment of potentially catastrophic technologies unless failure costs are internalized through sufficient private liability mechanisms.</div>

        <div class="paper-summary">This paper addresses the efficient allocation of government-held spectrum between non-commercial incumbents (federal agencies, defense) and commercial users when direct monetary transfers are prohibited and interference values are private information. Using optimal mechanism design theory, the authors characterize mechanisms that achieve efficient spectrum sharing without monetary transfers between parties, instead relying on costly inspections to verify interference claims. The key contribution is demonstrating how to achieve constrained efficiency in resource allocation problems where traditional market mechanisms fail due to transfer restrictions and information asymmetries.</div>

        <div class="paper-summary">This paper examines how a designer should optimally manage information revelation when agents have private signals about a common-value good and the designer seeks to maximize allocations without monetary transfers. Using a mechanism design approach that incorporates social learning dynamics, the authors characterize an optimal mechanism with two key parameters controlling allocation probability and learning intensity. The key finding is that the optimal mechanism strategically withholds allocations even when they would be socially efficient, as managing learning incentives requires this distortion to extract information and improve future allocation decisions.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="paper-summary">This paper investigates whether the strategic robustness property of agile online gradient descent (OGD) in repeated auctions—where bidders&#x27; learning cannot be exploited by auctioneers to extract excessive revenue—extends to other learning algorithms and auction formats. Using theoretical analysis, the authors prove that any no-regret learning algorithm applied to monotone bidding strategies via quantile representation achieves strategic robustness across any sequence of auction formats satisfying allocation monotonicity and voluntary participation, not just first-price auctions. The key contribution establishes a general bridge between no-regret learning theory and Myerson&#x27;s auction theory, showing that standard regret guarantees automatically translate to strategic robustness in this auction setting.</div>

      "abstract": "We develop an integrated framework for information design and mechanism design in screening environments with quasilinear utility. Using the tools of majorization theory and quantile functions, we show that both information design and mechanism design problems reduce to maximizing linear functionals subject to majorization constraints. For mechanism design, the designer chooses allocations weakly majorized by the exogenous inventory. For information design, the designer chooses information structures that are majorized by the prior distribution. When the designer can choose both the mechanism and the information structure simultaneously, then the joint optimization problem becomes bilinear with two majorization constraints. We show that pooling of values and associated allocations is always optimal in this case. Our approach unifies classic results in auction theory and screening, extends them to information design settings, and provides new insights into the welfare effects of jointly optimizing allocation and information.",

      "summary": "This paper addresses how to jointly optimize information provision and allocation mechanisms in screening environments where agents have private types and quasilinear utility. The methodology is theoretical, using majorization theory and quantile functions to reformulate both information design (choosing what information to reveal) and mechanism design (choosing allocation rules) as linear programming problems with majorization constraints. The key contribution is showing that when both information structure and allocation mechanism are jointly optimized, pooling of agent types and their associated allocations is always optimal, unifying results across auction theory and information design while revealing new welfare implications of simultaneous optimization."

      "title": "The Suicide Region: Option Games and the Race to Artificial General Intelligence",
      "authors": [
        "David Tan"
      ],
      "abstract": "Standard real options theory predicts delay in exercising the option to invest or deploy when extreme asset volatility or technological uncertainty are present. However, in the current race to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), sovereign actors are exhibiting behaviors contrary to theoretical predictions: the US and China are accelerating AI investment despite acknowledging the potential for catastrophic failure from AGI misalignment. We resolve this puzzle by formalizing the AGI race as a continuous-time preemption game with endogenous existential risk. In our model, the cost of failure is no longer bounded only by the sunk cost of investment (I), but rather a systemic ruin parameter (D) that is correlated with development velocity and shared globally. As the disutility of catastrophe is embedded in both players' payoffs, the risk term mathematically cancels out of the equilibrium indifference condition. This creates a \"suicide region\" in the investment space where competitive pressures force rational agents to deploy AGI systems early, despite a negative risk-adjusted net present value. Furthermore, we show that \"warning shots\" (sub-existential disasters) will fail to deter AGI acceleration, as the winner-takes-all nature of the race remains intact. The race can only be halted if the cost of ruin is internalized, making safety research a prerequisite for economic viability. We derive the critical private liability threshold required to restore the option value of waiting and propose mechanism design interventions that can better ensure safe AGI research and socially responsible deployment.",

      "summary": "This paper investigates why the US and China are accelerating AI investment despite catastrophic risks from AGI misalignment, contrary to standard real options theory that predicts delay under high uncertainty. Using a continuous-time preemption game model with endogenous existential risk, the authors show that when catastrophic failure costs are shared globally, the risk terms cancel out of equilibrium conditions, creating a \"suicide region\" where rational actors deploy AGI early despite negative risk-adjusted NPV. The key contribution is demonstrating that competitive racing dynamics can override individual rationality regarding existential risks, and that only internalizing ruin costs through private liability can restore proper option value and delay deployment until safety is assured."

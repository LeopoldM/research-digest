    <div class="intro">
        <strong>📊 Today's Summary</strong><br>
        This digest covers 14 papers spanning mechanism design, screening theory, auction theory, and climate policy. The majority focus on mechanism design applications across diverse domains including satellite networks, federated learning, multi-agent AI systems, and artificial general intelligence development. Of particular note for energy economics researchers is &quot;Optimal Carbon Prices in an Unequal World: The Role of Regional Welfare Weights,&quot; which directly addresses climate policy design, while several mechanism design papers explore resource allocation problems that may have applications in energy markets.

        <div class="paper-summary">This paper surveys incentive mechanism design approaches for resource management in satellite networks, examining how game theory and auction theory can address allocation challenges beyond traditional system-performance metrics. The methodology is a comprehensive literature review covering communication resource allocation, computation offloading, privacy/security, and coordination in satellite systems. The key contribution is demonstrating how economic-based incentive mechanisms can improve scalability, adaptability, and fairness by incorporating user rationality and behavior into satellite network resource management decisions.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="paper-summary">This paper examines why the US and China are accelerating AI investment despite catastrophic AGI risks, contrary to standard real options theory that predicts delay under extreme uncertainty. Using a continuous-time preemption game with endogenous existential risk, the authors show that when catastrophic failure costs are shared globally, the risk term cancels out of players&#x27; equilibrium conditions, creating a &quot;suicide region&quot; where rational actors deploy AGI early despite negative risk-adjusted NPV. The key contribution is demonstrating that competitive pressures can force premature deployment of potentially catastrophic technologies, and that only internalizing ruin costs through private liability can restore incentives for delay and safety research.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="paper-summary">This paper addresses the resource allocation problem for radio spectrum sharing between non-commercial incumbents (government, scientific institutions) and commercial users when direct monetary transfers are prohibited and both parties have private information about their valuations. The authors use theoretical mechanism design to characterize the optimal allocation mechanism under these constraints. The key contribution is developing a novel mechanism that achieves efficient spectrum sharing without monetary transfers by leveraging costly inspections and limited transfer instruments, providing a framework applicable to other government-held resources with similar characteristics.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="paper-summary">This paper examines how a designer should optimally manage information aggregation when allocating a common-value good to multiple agents without monetary transfers, where agents have partial private information about the good&#x27;s value. Using mechanism design theory, the authors characterize the optimal allocation mechanism through two key parameters: one controlling allocation probability and another governing learning incentives. The key finding is that the optimal mechanism sometimes withholds socially efficient allocations to maintain proper learning incentives, demonstrating a fundamental trade-off between immediate efficiency and information management in sequential allocation problems.</div>

        <div class="paper-summary">This paper investigates whether automated keyword-based recruitment systems contribute to artificially elevated frictional unemployment by creating semantic mismatches between job seekers and vacancies. Using controlled simulations, the authors compare traditional keyword screening with semantic matching based on high-dimensional vector representations of resumes and job descriptions. The key finding is that semantic matching substantially improves recall and matching efficiency without sacrificing precision, suggesting that outdated algorithmic hiring practices impose significant economic costs on labor market efficiency.</div>
